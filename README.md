## Description

The "Automated Census and Biodiversity Monitoring System using Deep Learning" is an ongoing project focused on developing an advanced protocol and workflow for wildlife monitoring using camera trapping, citizen science, and deep learning techniques. The primary objective of this project is to create a powerful Neural Network for species classification using camera-trap images obtained from Doñana National Park.

By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning methods, the project aims to achieve unbiased estimates of species and community dynamics. This will enable cost-effective and prompt responses to ecological changes, ultimately contributing to the conservation and understanding of biodiversity in the region.

## Features

- Utilization of camera-trap images from Doñana National Park.
- Generation of bounding boxes and JSON annotations for images in COCO format.
- Development of a comprehensive dataset for training, validation and evaluation.
<!--- Creation of a state-of-the-art Neural Network for species classification.-->
<!--- Advanced techniques for optimizing model performance and efficiency.-->


## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Dataset/`: Contains the dataset images.
- `Data/`: Contains the dataset corresponding annotations in COCO format, CSVs and JSONs.
- `Scripts/`: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, bounding box generation.
- `Assignment0_DataExploration/`: Visualize the statistics of the data.
